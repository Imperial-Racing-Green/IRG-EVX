Folders:
- core: 
    - basic data model
    - core image processing and data handling algorithms that are independent of the UI.
    - should be unit tested

- widgets:
    - ui widgets
    - data is provided to these, these don't normally fetch stuff
    - try to keep these independent of overall data structures
    - they can call controllers?

- tools:
    - extension of graphics widget
    - so many extensions, that it needs a folder

- services:
    - deal with the external world.
    - interface to other clients.
    - project files, exports etc.

- controllers:
    - operating logic
    - need:
        - appdata
        - image handling
        - data series mgmt
        - calibration
        - detection: auto, manual
        - measurements
